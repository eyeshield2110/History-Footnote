<h3>The goal of this website: </h3>


<p>
    I've recently picked up an interest for learning history. However, self-teaching yourself history effectively is difficult:
    Reading straight from a history textbook or dry academic essays is, at best, boring, and worse, painful and migraine-inducing.
</p>

<p>
    The best way that I've found so far to maintain my interest in the subject is through reading historical fiction.
</p>

<p>
    Indeed, while learning by rote the chain of events leading to the French Revolution sounds (and is) a dreadful task, it is much easier and pleasant to do so while reading about the swashbuckling adventures of a young man who, after his friend gets killed in a duel with the personification of evil aristocracy, goes on to become an actor, a swordfighter, a revolutionary and politician (and more!) all by accident, on his quest to avenge and honor his dead friend (from Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini).
</p>

<p>
    There's no wonder why ancient and primitive people had knowledge about the world imparted via mythologies and epic poetry: Human learn best with stories.
</p>

<p>In summary: The goal of this website is to combine my love for reading fiction and my interest in history, by relating history within storytelling. I would like
    "hiSTORY footNOTES" to help lower the effort-barrier that stops many readers from getting more out of their books.
</p>


<h3>General description:</h3>
<p>In one sentence, the main premise of "hiSTORY footNOTE" is learn history & culture through fiction literature.
    Hence, the website will to store and display the integral text of fictional works (novels, short stories, etc.) from the public domain.
    Inside the text, there will be something like "footnotes" inserted within the text itself, to facilitate access to intertextual information WITHOUT redirection to an external link, which would disturb the flow of reading.
<p>My inspiration for the working of my website are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://genius.com"> Genius</a>: this website stores song lyrics from all across musical genres (from rap, metal to musical theater), and users can provide annotations/analysis/etc. that are embedded within the text itself, instead of being at the bottom like a footnote or a comment under a post (see image 1) </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenberg</a>: This is an online library that stores public domain books and documents, and is, of course, a model for this online-book reading website.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>: Online encyclopediae form an addicted spider-y net of interconnecting knowledge, and that makes them very addictive (and easy to get lost in): this is something I hope to achieve with this website.
            I'd also like to use a similar tagging system for this website.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Structure of the website:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Home page: This will give access to the selection of books/stories</li>
    <li>Annotated text: Each book/story has its own page, containing its whole text available to read. </li>
    <li>The Archive: it organizes the historical notes from the book/stories' annotated page in a more traditional, encyclopedic way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pages/sections description:</h3>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Page</th>
        <th>Content of page/Sections of page</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Home<br><a href="#home_page">(see sketch in the "References" section below)</a></td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Stories are listed in a collage-like manner, like a <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/aubury37/novels/">Pinterest board</a>.
                    Clicking on a story/novel's cover will lead to the <a href="#story_page">page</a> dedicated to it.
                    The home page is therefore the website main menu (in form of pictures) where a user can scroll through the virtual "shelf", like an online library</li>
                <li>A side navigation bar that would give the option to search stories by time period and location, instead by cover (see <a href="#sidebar">example</a> in Reference section)</li>
            </ul>
            </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="story_page" rowspan="3">Annotated text (for each story/book)<br><a href="#story_page_sketch">(see sketch in the <br>"Reference" section below)</a></td>
        <td>Main section</td>
        <td>This contains the work's integral text along with embedded historical notes. The notes are "invisible", only marked by highlights in the text, until a user clicks on it, then the note pops up on the side, on the same page (there is no link redirecting). The goal here is to enrich the reading experience by providing encyclopedic-like resources next to the text itself without distracting a reader's flow by  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Extracted notes<br>(no text)</td>
        <td>Compilation of the notes from the main section, without the literary text. These notes are also organized and stores in the Historical Archive page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>External resources<br>to learn more</td>
        <td>A mediagraphy and links to other historical resources (including fictional works, novels, movies with similar settings; non-fiction historical books, documentaries, etc.) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Historical Archive</td>
        <td>This page is accessible from the side navigation bar.
            This page's purpose is to organize the historical notes from all novels by subject (ex. Battle of Waterloo, Gothic Architecture, etc.) with a tagging system.</td>
    </tr>
